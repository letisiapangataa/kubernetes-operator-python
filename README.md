# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Kubernetes BackupPolicy Operator ‚Äì Python/Kopf (Applied Lab Project)  

A **proof-of-concept Kubernetes operator** built to explore custom resource development and automation.  
The operator manages backups for stateful applications using PVC snapshots or S3-compatible storage.  
Includes a Helm chart for testing, basic Prometheus metrics, and a simple CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
